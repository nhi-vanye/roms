ROMS
====

This is an archived copy of `roms` from the mid-90s.

`roms` was a program I used to generate a "good" email signature
from a list of quotes (one per file). It took into account the the
addresses that the email was being sent too, so that the same email
sent to both your boss and friend would use the one for you your
boss.

It was designed and used with both mush and Z-mail

I need to find some sample signatures and config files from an old backup...
